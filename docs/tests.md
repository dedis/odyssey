# Tests

The system is only at an early maturity stage in term of testing. Some efforts
have been invested in preparing the ground for testing. Tehrefore, the DOManager
has a first batch of tests that demonstrates how to mock the httpserver, the
commands performed with os.exec, the external cloud provider and the task
manager. It is a good start to develop more tests across the system. Some other
elements like the catalog smart contract have been well tested. This shows the
way for testing the project smart contract.
